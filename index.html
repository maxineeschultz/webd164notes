<h1> My Favorite Beverage </h1>
<p>
    My favorite drink tends to vary depending on the current season. 
    For example, right now I really enjoy drinking tea at night before bed
    because I like to consume something that is warm in the cold winter time.
    I am currently a huge fan of this lavender camomile tea that I bought at
    the store this week. I love the taste and smell of lavender and the 
    combination of lavender and camomile has improved my quality of sleep.
